You got my mind so haywire, haywire
Runnin' crazy like you'll never know
And now that you've set a fire, fire
Throwin' on fuel and watchin' it grow
Well, I'm gettin' dizzy from the run around
Wastin' time tryin' to figure out
What your game is all about
You got me chasing you
Love me, let me go, just choose
'Cause you're leadin' me on, then leavin' me here
You're wearin' my heart like a souvenir
So cut me loose
Hold me tight or cut me loose
In the beginnin', we were perfect, perfect
Lightnin' and thunder, we were rolling strong
Somethin' inside me says it's worth it, worth it
But I, I can't keep holdin' on
'Cause I'm gettin' dizzy from the run around
Wastin' time tryin' to figure out
What your game is all about
You got me chasing you
Love me, let me go, just choose
'Cause you're leadin' me on, you're leavin' me here
You're wearin' my heart like a souvenir
So cut me loose
Hold me tight or cut me loose
We could make it to the end of time
Be the envy of every eye
If you would just make up your mind
You got me chasin' you
Love me, let me go, just choose
'Cause you're leadin' me on, then leavin' me here
You're wearin' my heart like a souvenir
So cut me loose
Hold me tight or cut me loose
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Hold me tight or cut me loose
