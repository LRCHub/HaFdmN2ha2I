Here I come with the new style,
kicking
Just can't help it, 'cause it's
so damn wicked
Insane in the brain with a mind
like Cujo
Ya better run, 'cause I'm about
to get loco
Feelin' this way is an everyday
thing, see
Ya talkin' shit, but you don't
know me
Ya look around, ya see we got
the most juice
Watch these fuckers jump when I
get loose
When I get loose
Watch these fuckers jump when I
get loose
When I get loose
Watch these fuckers jump
I guess it's OK, I guess not
Talkin' all that shit like a
big shot
Come by the masses or come by
the few
Ain't got nothin' but love for
this crew
And I can see that's why you're
so jealous
And I can see that's not your
excuse
And I can see that's why you're
so jealous
Watch these fuckers jump when I
get loose
When i get loose
Watch these fuckers jump when I
get loose
When I get loose
Watch these fuckers jump
When I get loose
